ANGULAR BASIC SAMPLE
====================

Fast start to play with Angular 1.x. The aim of this repo is having one clean & minimal base for testing purposes.

Just run `npm start` and you're ready to go :). This will install all dependencies and start your browser. Next time you only need to run `gulp`.
